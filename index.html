  <h2><center>To be held as part of

  Dallas, TX and online, Sunday, November 13, 2022
  </center></h2>

  <p>
  Research software engineers (RSEs) are critical to the impact of HPC, data science, and the larger scientific community. They have existed for decades, though often not under that name. The past several years, however, have seen the development of the RSE concept, common job titles, and career paths; the creation of professional networks to connect RSEs; and the emergence of RSE groups at universities, national laboratories, and industry.
  <p>
  This workshop will bring together RSEs and allies involved in HPC, from all over the world, to grow the RSE community by establishing and strengthening professional networks of current RSEs and RSE leaders. We'll discuss current activities and plans of national RSE organizations, needs of RSEs and RSE groups, and ways RSE organizations can help address these issues.
  <p>
  The workshop will be highly interactive, featuring breakout discussions and panels, as well as invited addresses and shorter talks.
